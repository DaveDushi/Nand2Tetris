# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the course Digital Systems (nand2tetris). Below is a brief description of each project:

## Project 1: Boolean Logic
We built all the logic gates described in Chapter 1, yielding a basic chip-set. The only building blocks used in this project are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates.

## Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
We built all the chips described in Chapter 2, leading up to an Arithmetic Logic Unit - the Hack computer's ALU. The only building blocks used are the chips described in chapter 1 and the chips that were built in this project.

## Project 3: Sequential Logic
We built all the chips described in Chapter 3, leading up to a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit. The only building blocks used are primitive DFF gates, chips that were built on top of them, and chips described in projects 1 and 2.

## Project 4: Machine Language Programming
We wrote some low-level assembly programs, with a goal to get a taste of low-level programming in machine language, and to get acquainted with the Hack computer platform.

## Project 5: Computer Architecture
we Completed the construction of the Hack CPU and the Hack hardware platform, leading up to the top-most Computer chip.

## Project 6: Assembler
We wrote an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.
## Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic
We built a basic VM translator, focusing on the implementation of the VM language's stack arithmetic and memory accesscommands. In Project 8, this basic translator will be extended into a full-scale VM translator.

## Project 8: VM II: Program control
We extended the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, in project 7 we focused on handling the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language. We now turn to handle the VM language's branching and function calling commands.

## Project 9: High-Level Language
We adopted the simple computer game Flappy Birds and implemented this application in Jack.

## Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
We built a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that renders the program's structure using marked-up text. In the next project, the logic that generates the XML output will be morphed into logic that generates VM code.

## Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
We extended the syntax analyzer built in project 10 into a full-scale Jack compiler. The output of the compiler should be VM code designed to run on the virtual machine implemented in projects 7-8.

## Project 12: Jack Operating System
Implemented parts of the Jack OS.

Please refer to the respective project folders for more detailed information, including source code, documentation, and any additional resources that may be available.

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of computer systems and programming concepts.

## Usage
Each project folder contains its own set of instructions and documentation for running and testing the project components.
